# üìö FastAPI Book Dictionary App

Welcome to the FastAPI Book Dictionary App! This project is designed to help you manage a collection of books with ease. You can store book titles, descriptions, and ratings, and perform all the essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The app uses SQLAlchemy for database management and FastAPI for creating a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework.

## üöÄ Features

- **Add New Books**: Easily add a new book with its title, description, and rating.
- **View All Books**: Retrieve a list of all books in the collection.
- **View Book Details**: Get detailed information about a specific book using its ID.
- **Update Book Information**: Update the details of an existing book.
- **Delete Books**: Remove a book from the collection by its ID.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
- **SQLAlchemy**: The Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library.
- **SQLite**: A C library that provides a lightweight, disk-based database.

## üì¶ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastapi-book-dictionary-app.git
   cd fastapi-book-dictionary-app
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to access the interactive API documentation provided by Swagger UI.
